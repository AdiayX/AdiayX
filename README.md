###AdiayX Development News:

**AdiayX Development is searching for a few JavaScript Developers :D** 
- ` I ` = @AdiayX#8830

We are currently looking for a developer for the AdiayX botlist panel.

On the panel, users will be able to upload, edit and delete bots from the botlist. Since we want to log the whole thing in channels on the future support server, both the panel and the bot, which is specially coded for it, must be written in JS. However, since I can only discord.js, we are now looking for a developer who will code the add, edit and delete functions of the panel. I'll take care of the design (html, css).
In the following list you will find the requirements that you should bring with you if you would like to develop with/for us.

__Requirements__:
- Extremely good knowledge of Javascript
- Knowledge of databases such as SQL etc.
- A Github account where we can see what you've got (we look at your repositories)
- You must be at least 13/14 years old (because Discord ToS), there are no exceptions

__Beneficial Skills__:
- HTML, css
- various Discord knowledge
- various knowledge of Photoshop or similar image processing software

Do you have more knowledge that is **not** listed here? Let us know in your application ^^
